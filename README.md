# interview

Dear Mark:

Sorry for the later, as I was outside with my daughter this morning.

This is the solution: 
1. class of Portfolio is used to store the input/output data
2. class of Simulator is used to process the data
3. class of test is used to print out the result

NOTE: 
1. Lib needs to import:
       - org.apache.commons.math3 (for your convenience, I just uploaded into the GIT)
2. Sample output:
Monte Carlo Simulation

Portfolio Type - Aggressive:

     - initialInvestment = 100000
     - return = 0.094324
     - risk = 0.15675
     - Median = 244925
     - 10% Best = 551271
     - 10% Worst = 101446

Portfolio Type - Very Conservative:

     - initialInvestment = 100000
     - return = 0.06189
     - risk = 0.063438     
     - Median = 156917     
     - 10% Best = 220040     
     - 10% Worst = 111290

Please kindly help to review.
If there is any questions, please let me know. 

Thanks for your time. 
Good day.
Jason
