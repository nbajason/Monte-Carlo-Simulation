# interview

Dear Mark:

Sorry for the later, as I was outside with my daughter this morning.

This is the solution: 
- class of Portfolio is used to store the input/output data
- class of Simulator is used to process the data
- class of test is used to print out the result

NOTE: 
Lib needs to import:
- org.apache.commons.math3 (for your convenience, I just uploaded into the GIT)


Please kindly help to review.
If there is any questions, please let me know. 

Thanks for your time. 
Good day.
Jason
